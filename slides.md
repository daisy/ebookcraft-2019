What's A11y?
- how AT works on the web
- why you care
- but how do you make it happen in your org? 
- Inclusivity and a11y


All on the same page
- the necessity to obtain corporate commitment
- the importance of defining accessibility requirements, for vendors and internal production departments
- plan out your testing approach
- ensure the consistency and accessibility of the workflow itself
- what might that workflow involve?
- educate your staff, but not only: also hire experts

How a11y works
How AT works on the web (a11y tree and all)
Demo: how to use a screen reader to quickly test a11y.
epub:type -> why is it not critical to a11y?
ARIA roles -> why, when, where?
Not a 1-1 mapping: practical examples of how to add DPUB ARIA roles in addition to existing epub:types.

Resources!
- in addition to web a11y tools
- how to rely on EPUB-centric best practices (for instance from DAISY’s KB, or from the EPUB 3 CG)
- automated checking strategies (why? how? when?)
- Ace demo
- automated testing is great but it’s not everything… 

Manual labor 
(1 from rachel)
- accessible audits and QA  
- the definition and inclusion of accessibility metadata
