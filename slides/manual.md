## Manual checking: blood, sweat, and .. oh that wasn't so bad

---

We just finished talking about how wonderful automated accessibility checking is!

---

But there are things that robots don't do well.

| Example | Passes auto? | Actually accessible? |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
|`<img alt="Picture" .../>`|âœ…|ðŸš«|

### So what does manual testing entail?

The EPUB Accessibility spec describes WCAG usage for EPUB

as well as EPUB-specific requirements.

---

So, just read all the documents:

- EPUB Accessibility 1.0 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- EPUB 3 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- WCAG <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- ARIA <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- DPUB-ARIA <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- DIAGRAM (image descriptions) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

And then cross-reference that with what's in your EPUB.

<p>
<style>
span.extra {
  color: yellow;
}
span.extraa {
  color: orange;
  font-size: larger;
}
</style>
<span class="fragment">Video?</span> <span class="fragment">Audio?</span> <span class="fragment">Text?</span> <span class="fragment">Images?</span> <span class="fragment extra">Captions?</span> <span class="fragment extra">Tables?</span> <span class="fragment extra">Stylish but illegible fonts?</span> <span class="fragment extra extraa">Print page equivalents?</span> <span class="fragment extra extraa">Media overlays?</span>
</p>

Just to name a few. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

And 5 hours later, you've got 25 browser tabs, 2 text editors, and 3 reading systems open; and you're not sure if this was really a good idea.

---

### Do you feel overwhelmed?

All you wanted to do was make your book accessible! It'll be easy, they said...

### Truth

Manual testing takes time and patience and resources.

---
