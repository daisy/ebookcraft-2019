## Behold: accessible EPUB

---

### EPUB and the Web

EPUB 3 is built on web languages (HTML, CSS) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

And the web has extensive accessibility support (WAI, WCAG, ARIA, A11y Tree) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

This is great! So all the accessibility stuff that works on the web should work in my EPUB? Yes but... <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Differences between EPUB and the Web when it comes to a11y

  - Reading order: Unlike websites, books have a linear progression 	
  - There's always a table of contents                                <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Discovery metadata                                                <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

The ecosystem is complicated

### Devils and details

üòà

Specific ways you can optimize your usage of EPUB accessibility features.

---

### (table of) Content(s) is king

Enables users to choose where to go in the content.

This is a very important mechanism for non-visual readers. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Putting yourself out there

Show off your accessibility features

with discovery metadata in the package document. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
```
<meta property="schema:accessMode">textual</meta>
<meta property="schema:accessibilityHazard">flashing</meta>
<meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">alternativeText</meta>
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="width: 100%" -->

---

### So like, what's your type?

And why it might not impact what you think it does. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### `epub:type`

The `epub:type` attribute was introduced in EPUB 3 as a way to extend semantics.

Values come from EPUB 3's extensive structural semantics vocabulary. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

The promise of `epub:type` was to extend a generic XHTML element with publishing-specific refinements.

```
<div epub:type="prologue">"Lorem ipsum dolor," he thought.</div>
```
  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

And then, reading systems could expose this information to users, which would really enhance accessibility.

---

### Reality check

You can very thoroughly add `epub:type` everywhere, but you'll notice that the reading experience doesn't change.

Why? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

It was never really adopted by reading systems ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### The exception: footnotes and endnotes

A reading system might pop up a little box to show the footnote inline:

```
<p>lorum ipsum.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#fn01">1</a></p>
<aside epub:type="footnote">
‚Ä¶
</aside>
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

Beyond this, though, there are no known implementations that provide an enhanced user experience via `epub:type`.

Don't rely on it alone. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### ARIA

Remember how we talked about EPUB leveraging web accessibility?

---

The W3C created ARIA specifically for making content more accessible.

ARIA consists of roles, features, and properties. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

And, of course, rules for how to use it. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

```
<div role="checkbox"
     aria-checked="false"
     tabindex="0">
  ...
</div>
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

Let's see how `epub:type` and ARIA are related.

---

### Roleplay

There's a set of digital publishing roles for ARIA (ARIA DPUB).

E.g. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

```
<section role="chapter" aria-label="chapter 1">
  <p>Once upon a time ‚Ä¶</p>
  ‚Ä¶
</section>
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

But, be careful -- don't assume a 1-1 mapping between `epub:type` and ARIA

```
<body epub:type="cover">
  <h1>Sports!</h1>
  <img src="cover.jpg" alt="An olympic athlete in mid-pole vault"/>
</body>
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

vs <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

```
<body epub:type="cover">
  <h1>Sports!</h1>
  <img role="doc-cover" src="cover.jpg" alt="An olympic athlete in mid-pole vault"/>
</body>
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
